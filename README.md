# Examples for the ICAT school 2019

This repository contains the examples for the 2019 ICAT school statistics
course.

To run the examples interactively either clone the repository to your local
computer or alternatively run them using a Binder instance by clicking this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/terhardt/ICAT-stats/testing)

The `ar1.py` file contains a small collection of functions related to the
estimation and sampling of AR(1) processes. It is used in many of the examples
which is why it is split out into an extra file.
